# Diffie Hellman Project
This is a python script that's hard coded to print (g^b)^a mod p, to get the secret key for the Diffie Hellman project. It uses a modular exponentiation function to do this (non-compository). It also has code to get the value p, but it is commented out.

The other constant values were given as specified through the class project

Run using: python main.py
